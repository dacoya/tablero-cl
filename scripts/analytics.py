"""
Derived rankings: smart sorts and the store leaderboard.

Rewritten over SQL. The previous version operated on DataFrames and re-parsed
price strings on every row; prices are numeric on disk now, so converting them
back into "$45.990" just to re-parse would be pure waste.

SQLite has no median aggregate, so the median-per-game CTE below picks the
middle row(s) by ROW_NUMBER and averages them -- correct for both odd and even
counts. Median matters here rather than mean: one absurdly-priced listing should
not redefine what a game "normally" costs.

Pure: connection in, list[dict] out. Nothing prints.
