Game search: FTS candidate generation + fuzzy ranking.

Two stages, deliberately separated:

  1. SQLite FTS5 decides what is *plausible* -- cheap, indexed, and it replaces
     the old full scan that ran rapidfuzz over every unique title on every
     keystroke.
  2. rapidfuzz decides what is *relevant*, using the same blended score the
     previous implementation tuned, plus a kind penalty so sleeves and boosters
     stop outranking the game they are named after.

Pure: takes a connection, returns list[dict]. Nothing here prints.
