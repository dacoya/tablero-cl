"""
Scrape orchestration.

Extracted from cli.py so the terminal and the TUI share one implementation.
The TUI previously had to fabricate an argparse Namespace, mutate five of its
attributes and call `cli.cmd_update` -- depending on the CLI's parser shape to
do a job that has nothing to do with parsing.

Scrapes run concurrently; the database is written serially, because a sqlite3
connection is not safe to share across threads and serial writes keep the
transaction simple.
