"""
Price alerts, for cron.

Rewritten over the database. Two sources:

    watchlist -- every watched game with a target price (the normal case)
    ad-hoc    -- explicit queries plus one shared threshold

The watchlist path is the reason this is worth having: targets are stored, so a
scheduled run needs no arguments and cannot drift out of sync with what you
actually told the tool you wanted.

Emits the same alert shape the previous JSON-file version did, so anything
already consuming that output keeps working.
