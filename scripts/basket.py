"""
Wishlist basket optimisation.

Given a set of games, work out where to actually buy them. The naive answer --
buy each game wherever it is cheapest -- is usually wrong in practice, because
every extra store adds a shipping fee. This module reports both ends and a
greedy middle:

    split    : each game from its cheapest store (the price floor, most parcels)
    single   : the best one-store order (one parcel, usually incomplete)
    optimal  : greedy multi-store, adding a store only while it pays for itself

All functions are pure: connection in, plain dicts out. Nothing prints.
