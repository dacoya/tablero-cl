"""
Filesystem paths for tablero-cl, resolved independently of the current
working directory.

Historically the code used ``'../data/...'`` strings that only resolved
correctly when run from inside ``scripts/``. Resolving from *this module's*
location instead lets the ``tablero`` command work from any directory.

Where the data lives depends on how the package was installed, in this order:

  1. ``TABLERO_DATA_DIR`` -- an explicit override, which is what lets a sync
     job, a scratch copy, or a test fixture point somewhere else.
  2. ``<repo>/data`` when running from a source checkout (editable install or
     ``python -m tablero.cli``), so development keeps using the tracked CSVs.
  3. A per-user data directory otherwise. A normal ``pip install`` puts the
     package under ``site-packages``, and writing a 15 MB database there would
     be wrong: it is not the user's data, and a reinstall would delete it.

Pure ``pathlib`` with no cross-module imports, so nothing else in the package
has to be importable before the data root is known.
