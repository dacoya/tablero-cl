"""
Price history over recorded observations.

Rewritten against the price_obs table. The previous version read a JSON file
keyed on "norm|store", which collided whenever two distinct products in one
store normalised to the same string -- 77 series in the old file had duplicate
timestamps and meaningless trend lines. Keying on product id removes the
ambiguity entirely.

Pure: connection in, plain data out. `sparkline` is the one presentation piece
and takes a plain list, so it stays usable anywhere.
