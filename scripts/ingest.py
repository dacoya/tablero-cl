"""
Write scraped records into the database.

Replaces merge_to_json's snapshot diffing. Because product identity is stable
here (store + canonical URL), new/restock detection and price history fall out
of comparing against the rows already present -- no previous-snapshot file has
to be kept around and re-read.

Per store, so a partial or failed scrape never touches another store's data.
