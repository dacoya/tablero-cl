"""
SQLite connection and schema management.

The database is the canonical store: prices are numeric, the cross-store match
key is persisted, and product identity is stable across scrapes. That makes the
file directly readable by an external consumer (the Android app reads this same
file via Room) with no Python-side translation.

Everything here is I/O plumbing only -- no business logic, no printing.
