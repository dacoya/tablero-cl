"""
One-time import of the legacy JSON files into SQLite.

Reads products.json / history.json / metadata.json, derives the fields that
previously existed only in memory (numeric prices, cleaned title, norm,
canonical URL), and writes data/tablero.db.

Non-destructive: the JSON files are only read. Returns a report dict; printing
is the caller's job.

The history mapping is the lossy part and is reported honestly. Legacy history
keyed on "norm|store", which collides when two distinct products in one store
normalize to the same string. Where a key maps to exactly one product the
series is carried over; where it is ambiguous or orphaned it is counted and
dropped rather than arbitrarily assigned.
